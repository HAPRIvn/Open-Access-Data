# Data Information
Country name in the data is coded according to ISO 3166-1 numeric and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, which are used by, for example, [United Nation Trade Statistics (UN COMTRADE)](https://comtrade.un.org/) (ISO 3166-1 numeric),  [World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)](https://wits.worldbank.org/) (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3) and [World Bank Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3).

Additionally, the data for the U.S. is [FIPS compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code) for the State and County code, which means any data from the U.S. federal government can be merged into this data, i.e., Census data, Infrastructure, Health, Education, Import & Export data, etc.

I believe with the added geographic coding work; this data can be put into great use by researchers all over the world, especially in economic and health impact evaluation, which is why I made this free to access for educational and academic purposes on the Institute's website and this repository.
